 Game of Thrones Characters App

This **Game of Thrones mobile app** allows users to explore detailed information about characters from the iconic TV series. It was built as a personal learning project to deepen my understanding of **Flutter**, particularly focusing on **state management**, **clean architecture**, and **API integration**.

### 🔑 Features

* 🔍 **Character Search**
  Easily search for Game of Thrones characters by name.

* 📄 **Character Details**
  View in-depth character info (name, house, image, etc.) retrieved via a REST API.

  Separation of concerns with clear layers for UI, logic, and data.

* 🧠 **Optimized Data Flow & caching**
  Ensures minimal rebuilds and efficient updates using proper state flows.

### 🧠 Learning Focus

This project was built to explore:

* Bloc and Cubit patterns for reactive state management.
* Flutter best practices and file structure design.
* API fetching, parsing JSON data, and handling edge cases.
* Managing loading, success, and error states cleanly.
* Writing maintainable and scalable Dart code.


### 🛠️ Tech Stack
